# 1.Write a Java program to test that a given array of integers of length 2 contains a 4 or a 7. 
### Sample Output:
### Original Array: [5, 7]                                                 
### true 


# 2.Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array (length 3) of integers.
### Sample Output:
### Original Array: [20, 30, 40]                                           
### Larger value between first and last element: 40 


# 3.Write a Java program to swap the first and last elements of an array (length must be at least 1) and create a new array. 
### Sample Output:
### Original Array: [20, 30, 40]                                           
### New array after swapping the first and last elements: [40, 30, 20] 


# 4.Write a Java program to find all of the longest word in a given dictionary.
 
### Example:
### {
### "cat",
### "dog",
### "red",
### "is",
### "am"
### }
### Result: "cat", "dog", "red"
